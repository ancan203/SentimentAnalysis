# SentimentAnalysis
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a task in natural language processing that identifies specific aspects mentioned in a text and determines the sentiment expressed toward each aspect. For example, in the sentence ”The food was great but the service was slow,” ABSA would identify two aspects—food and service—and classify the sentiment toward each as positive and negative. This project explores ABSA in Vietnamese using the VLSP 2018 ABSA dataset. Our goal is to develop a strong transformer-based model using PhoBERT for this task, skipping over traditional machine learning models which do not leverage contextual embeddings effectively.

The significance of this work lies in developing sentiment analysis tools that can better handle language-specific challenges and cultural contexts. By improving ABSA in Vietnamese, we also help extend NLP research to underrepresented languages. This has practical applications in areas like customer review analysis and broader importance for building inclusive, multilingual NLP systems.
